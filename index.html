    <h1>VPN</h1>

    <h3>A Virtual Private Network works by connecting to a server, then it, this moves your ip to that of the server this hides your ip, sometimes results in other benefits. Concealing your ip from malicious actors is important using your ip your location and much more info can be traced. The data sent to the vpn server is sometimes encrypted but not always, so if you are using a vpn make sure you use a good encrypted one.
        Sometimes a vpn is used to circumvent certain restrictions such as local user blocking website,(ChatGPT), or big companyâ€™s setting restrictions (Netflix).</h3>
    <h1>Example of VPN use:</h1>

    <h1>Fake Email</h1>
    
    <h3>Fake emails are used as tools for avoiding spam emails, as they are tmeporary and are in no way connected to you, they are good for certain use cases where if you're doing something sketchy this is a way to avoid being linked to it as you can use the fake eail to generate disposable credentials.  </h3>

    <h1>Digital Foot Print</h3>
    
        <h2>Active VS Passive -> Consequences</h3>    
    <h3>Active is where you submit somehting like a social media account or aa youtube channel, so you know it happend because you submitted it yourself. Passive is done without your consent where they scrape the web for stuff related to and that could be traced to you, this is done without consent. The consequences of this are that both passive and active info can be used against you in cyber vetting, Hacking, and sharing of your private info.</h3>

    <h1>IP Grabber</h1>
    <h3>Most every device that connects to the internet has two different IP codes, one that is public and another is private, some of the best IP grabbers can take your private ip in just one click. The IP code consists of numerical values witch can be deciphered in the location. Grabbers are used to steal these numbers and other web based utilites are used to decyther and abuse the ip, some bad use cases would be to steal somebodies location or launch a dos, or denial of service attack. </h3>

    <h1>Ad Blockers</h1>
    <h3>Another way to stay safe on the internet is using an ad-blocker these work in a variety of ways but the best ones that are run on a raspberry pi for the whole network block the server adressed for the ads so that they could never load in the first place. In our modern world where ads rule the internet its shockingly easy to get an ad blocker you can ust look up ad blocker extension and add the first one to chrome or any other browser that you use. Some websites like youtube are beginning to fight back against ad-blockers by blocking users witht hem from using the website temporarily.</h3>

    <h1>Virtual Machines</h1>
    <h3>There are many benefits to virtual machines, and some draw backs. One benefit is that they offer more control of the os, they are isolated so you can run stuff in them and absolutltely wreck the vm, and it wouldn't do anything to your pc.One cons is that They are still vunerable, they can still connect to thing makieing them less secure, and people can still be forgetful resulting in mistakes with interent privacy and security. </h3>

    <h1>Social Justice Issue</h1>
    <h2>Targeted Surveailnce and Lack of Regulations</h2>
    <h3>Currently there are little to no regulations in what websites can track, mostly websites are after data that can be resold to use against you in targeted ads, this is a huge issue with tons of data being collected about children, and other who don't want theier data to be collected. Sometimes this data can be used directly against you, maybe a potenial empolyer got your data, they could deny your job application just based of of that.  </h3>
